Before we get into the details of our expedition, lets get familiar with few initial details and how we get there.

<p>The first Indian expedition to Antarctica was initiated in 1981 by the then prime minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi. The first 3 expeditions were summer expeditions and the 4th expedition marked the beginning of overwintering expeditions. The first winter expedition was in 1984 in the first Indian Base, Dakshin Gangotri. One of the glaciers of Dronning Maud land, East Antarctica is named after this base. Ship would sail off the coast of goa on voyage to Antarctica and was the only means of travel for Indian expedition teams.</p>
