<p>The first thing that comes to anyone's mind is that why we go to Antarctica? What's the mission? How it all began?</p>

<p>Yes, like many other countries of the world, India has contributed significantly to the Antarctic science & research with permanently manned research stations on this icy continent!</p>

<p>Out of many other reasons behind the quest to explore the Antarctic continent, one of the prime reason is that, Antactica is the natural freezer of our planet Earth preserving plethora of information under the ice intact since years. It is a natural laboratory that has attracted scientists & researchers from various disciplines from all over the world to do their research work. India also joined the club of countries exploring this unexplored white continent.</p>

<p>So, let us know how an Indian connection to Antactica originated in the past. It is traced to the joint agreement between Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) & Hydrometeorological Centre of Russia under which Indians like Dr. Paramjit Singh Sehra participated in the 17th Soviet Antarctic Expedition [1971-1973]</p>

<p>The first Indian expedition to Antarctica, code-named <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/we-couldnt-tell-our-wives-remembering-operation-gangotri-the-top-secret-expedition-that-first-took-india-to-antarctica-9050676/#:~:text=Marine%20biologist%20Dr%20S%20Z%20Qasim,since%20the%20outcome%20was%20uncertain.&text=%E2%80%9CThe%20operation%20was%20very%20secretive%E2%80%A6">Operation Gangotri</a>, was flagged off in the year 1981. As there was no Indian base on this frigid white continent, initially expeditions were held during summer time only that generally falls between November to April. It was the year 1983 -1984 when the first Indian base was established in Antarctica called  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakshin_Gangotri">Dakshin Gangotri</a>. This marked a beginning of the era when an Indian team started wintering in Antarctica to carry out their scientific work. Dakshin Gangotri base was abondoned in 1988 - 1989 after it was submerged under the ice & was decommissioned in the year 1990. Thereafter, one more Indian research base named<a href="https://ncpor.res.in/antarcticas/display/376-maitri-">Maitri</a> was constructed on an ice free, rocky area on the Schirmarcher Oasis which is about 100 Kms inland from the shelf. In the year 2012, the third Indian research station named <a href="https://ncpor.res.in/antarcticas/display/377-bharati">Bharati</a>  was commissioned, which is situated in the rocky mountain area of Larsemann hills.</p>

<p>So, how can we participate in an Indian Antarctic Expedition? Indian Scientific Expeditions to Antarctica are managed & executed by the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research <a href="https://ncpor.res.in/pages/display/275-organisation">(NCPOR)</a> which is an autonomous Research & Development Institution under Ministry of Earth Sciences <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Earth_Sciences">(MoES)</a>. Project proposals from scientists & researchers across the country are evaluated by an expert team at NCPOR & team comprising of members from different organisations & universities is formed based on the rigorous evaluation process, details of which can be found on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Earth_Sciences">NCPOR web portal</a>.</p>


<p>Expedition team is classified based on various aspects like the duration for which the team stays in Antarctica, mode that they take to reach Antarctica, etc.<br>

Classification based on the duration of stay in Antarctica:<br>
1) Short Term or Summer Team: Expedition team that stays & works in Antarctica during Antarctic summer (generally between Nov to April)<br>
2) Long Term or Winter team: Expedition team that stays & works in Antarctica year round.<br>

Classification based on the mode of travel to Antarctica:<br>
1) Team that reaches Antarctica through flight<br>
2) Team that reaches Antarctica through ship (generally called voyage team)<br>

Teams are formed based on their scientific objectives, work profile, seat availability, & expedition requirements. Every team comprises of two types of members generally classified based on the type of work they are responsible for doing in Antarctica.<br>
Classification based on the type of work in Antarctica:<br>
1) Scientific (responsible for doing scientific research work in Antarctica)<br>
2) Logistic (responsible for executing logistic operations in Antarctica)<br>

So, this is all about the team formation & classification that in itself is quite interesting as we get to know people from various domains in different phases of our expedition that I will talk about in subsequent chapters. Various teams are formed comprising of summer/winter members or scientific/logistic members. One team takes the voyage route to reach Antarctica & rest of the teams fly to Antarctica as per their respective schedules.</p>

<p>Wait.... Getting selected for the expedition is not enough! There are few more challenges that every expedition team member has to face after which only he / she is qualified to take part in an Antarctic expedition. We had to undergo a thorough medical examination at All India Institute of Medical Sciences <a href="https://aiims.edu/index.php/en">(AIIMS)</a>, New Delhi that was almost a week long process. Following which, a physical fitness training was held under the expert guidance of Indo Tibettan Border Police Force (ITBPF) officials at Mountaineering & Skiing Institute <a href="https://www.itbpolice.nic.in/">(M&SI)</a>, Auli, Uttarakhand, details of which are shared in a separate chapter. On successful completing of all the tests, participants get the final clearance to take part in an Antarcic expediton.</p>

<p>Members of the expedition team report NCPOR, Goa as per their respective schedules. The team flies to Cape Town, South Africa which is the launching point of Indian Antarctic Expedition. The Antactic Logistics Centre International <a href="https://www.ch-aviation.com/airlines/LCI">(ALCI)</a> is responsible for the intercontinental air bridge between Cape Town, South Africa & Novolazarevskaya, Antarctica. A blue ice runway operated by ALCI serves the Indian station Maitri & Russian station Novolazarevskaya. Flying team members reach Antarctica through special flights operated by ALCI. From Cape Town, the team flies to Maitri station & from there they take another flight to Bharati station.<br>

Voyage team board the ice breaker ship from Cape Town, South Africa that sails to both the Indian Research stations in Antarctica & returns back to Cape Town at the end of Antarctic summer season. I was fortunate to be part of the voyage team of 36<sup>th</sup> Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarcica (ISEA-36) that took place during the year 2016 - 2017. So, I will be sharing my voyage experiences in more detail in subsequent chapters.</p>
