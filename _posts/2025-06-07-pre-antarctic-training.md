<p>The first thing one has to do before heading for an Antarctic expedition is to prove that he/she is medically & physically fit as per the set norms of Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica. Every participant has to appear for a pre-defined set of medical tests and physical fitness training.  Medical tests of all the team members were arranged at AIIMS, New Delhi following which physical fitness training was to be done at ITBPF M&SI, Auli, Uttarakhand. I started my journey to New Delhi from my home to appear for the medical tests. It was almost 5-6 days rigorous schedule of variety of medical tests from the day of reporting. Here is the first chance to get introduced to the team of expeditioners from various parts of the country.  But wait, keep in mind that this may not be the same set of people you will be travelling with while going to Antarctica. Few of them will be your voyage team mates & others may be flying directly to Bharati or Maitri station whom you may get a chance to meet directly at Antarctica. Or sometimes you may not even meet again! So, here is the catch. Excitement of having someone already known to you in no man’s land is the best part of it..!!</p>

<p>Most of the medical examination was carried out at AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences), New Delhi as per schedule. Few of the tests were at some other laboratories or clinics & so we spent most of the time travelling from here to there & getting ourselves medically examined. We also got some free time to explore the Indian capital city of New Delhi. We did not miss the chance & visited many places like Kutub Minar, India Gate, Parliament house, National Museum, Delhi metro station, etc. On the last day of medical examination, we received our consolidated medical reports. Most of us were non-medical people so were looking for the final comments of the doctor saying that we are medically fit for the expedition..!! Great relief indeed..!! By the way, this was not true in my case as I was detected with a gallstone that I needed to be removed before heading for the expedition..!! Okay, this was to be attended on my return after next 10 days of physical fitness training that was awaiting us to be discovered..!!</p>

<p>After successful completion of medical examination at New Delhi, the team was ready for the next phase of pre-Antarctic test which was physical fitness training at Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) Mountaineering & Skiing Institute based at Auli, Uttarakhand.</p>

<p>In the early morning, expedition team members assembled at the Prithvi Bhavan, New Delhi for departure. A small bus & a mini van were arranged for our travel. We divided ourselves in two groups & started our travel from Delhi. After covering some distance, we stopped at a nice restaurant on the highway for breakfast. The bus journey became exciting and scenic as we approached north side covering places like Haridwar & Rishikesh. Our lunch was arranged at a beautiful place near river Ganga at Rishikesh. Along the way, we encountered various river confluences like Karnaprayag, Rudraprayag, Devprayag, etc. The day’s journey ended late evening at the city called Srinagar in Garhwal district in Uttarakhand. The next day early morning started with nice drizzle on the way to Auli from Srinagar. The journey from Srinagar to Auli was in the lush green, cloud covered mountainous region of Uttarakhand.</p>

<p>Finally, the bumpy ride of the bus ended & we reached ITBP campus at Auli. We were welcomed by ITBP officials & got our rooms assigned. Female participants were allotted rooms in the Officer’s hostel whereas male participants were allotted common dormitory style lodging in Antarctica huts. All the required gears like normal jacket, puff jacket, pant, t-shirts, cap, trekking shoes, crampons, ice axe, small & big back packs, water bottle, sleeping bag, string, belay, crash helmet, etc. were distributed to us which we were going to need for the next 10 days of training program.</p>

<p>Initial part of our training was done at and around the ITBP Auli campus which included trekking with load, practical sessions on various types of knots & anchors, experience sharing by veteran Antarcticans, indoor & outdoor games, etc. Expedition team members along with ITBP officials were taken to Mana village – the last village at the Uttarakhand Indo-Tibetan border or home to the holy Badrinath dham – for the rest part of the training. This included trekking on mountain rocks with 15-20 Kg load, glacier snow craft training, rescue training, tent pitching, rock climbing, rappling, belaying, etc. During our stay at Mana village, we visited the famous Badrinath temple whenever we got some time for ourselves. Natural surroundings of this place kept on refilling the energy in everyone of us!</p>


<p>Finally, the last few days of the training was held in ITBP Auli with some trekking & tests of everything that we learned during these days. A very unique memory of these days was the sound of a whistle that we used to hear that signalled us to rush to the dining hall from wherever we were. It may be for morning breakfast, lunch, evening soup time or for dinner. The water we used for drinking was hot water as our trainers used to say that it was advisable to drink hot water in cold climate of mountains. Here we could learn that a simple knot that we form to tie our shoe laces can also have so many types & meanings. We used to learn so many unique things from our trainers that are even useful today and we could not have learned from anywhere else. Finally, it all concluded with a nice memorable closing ceremony & the batch left this place with special life time memories...!!</p>
